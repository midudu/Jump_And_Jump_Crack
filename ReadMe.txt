This python script is used to crack a popular WeChat game -- Jump And Jump

To make the program run successfully, you need:
1 python27
2 screen projection tools (this game is only on the mobile phone, so you have
to project your mobile phone screen onto the computer, I use TotalControl Software
as the screen projection tools)


How to do with the program and the screen projection tools:
1 connect the mobile phone to the computer
2 let computer get control of the phone ( use mouse click to get instead of touch 
the phone screen)
3 run the python script
4 let the mouse point to the start position, and press 'A'-Key on the keyboard;
then let the mouse point to the destination, and press 'A'-Key again;
5 Continue doing the 4th procedure
